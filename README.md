!For start app:
npm install expo-cli
!About app:
Our app is aimed at a possible solution to the problem of sitting too long on the phone and subsequently avoiding the real world and people.
 We wanted to create something that would unite people and make them spend time together in person.
 At the same time, our app will help everyone find hidden gems in other cities or even their own
!Quick introduction:
When opening the application, we can make a deposit or register. Then we get to the main page, where we can scroll the feed with random locations.
We can go to the introduction to the beginning, where we can see more straightforward offers for you, and also save some offers.
The third tab is adding your post.
The fourth tab gives us the opportunity to select a friend's profile to send messages to (in our layout, this is Rachel).
The fifth tab is the profile, which also has a transition to more advanced settings
